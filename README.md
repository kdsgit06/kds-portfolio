📖 Project Story
I wanted a professional portfolio to showcase my projects and skills.

Started with a blank React + Vite + TypeScript setup.

Designed a layout in Figma and implemented it with Tailwind + shadcn/ui.

Built reusable components (ProjectCard, Navbar, Hero, ContactForm).

Added custom Tailwind theme (colors, fonts) to give it a unique style.

Optimized images and deployed on Vercel with a 90+ Lighthouse score.
